# My final exam for ETH certification

Student: Luis Alejandro Vega Lozano

## Dev Environment
* `solc` - 0.4.6
* `node` - v6.8.1
* `Truffle` - 2.1.1

## Project Link
* [https://github.com/luismontreal/eth_final_exam]

##IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
* For Unit Testing to work you need to run TESTRPC with the param --blocktime=1 so it actually mines blocks.
* I focus intensively on the .sol files and I demonstrated knowledge in web3 and truffle, that being said:
* My Frontend skills suck, HTML and JS, I didn't add frontend validation. The contracts take care
* I tested and unit tested the project, if for any reason it does't run for you feel free to let me know at luismontreal@gmail.com
* Also, if the project is not satisfactory please let me know and I'll address it.
* I enjoyed this project and learned a lot on these past weeks, Many thanks!
